    "Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity, to seize everything you ever wanted in one moment. Would you capture it, or just let it slip? His palms are sweaty, knees weak.",
    "Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality. Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see. I am just a poor boy."
